# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
Machine learning model which predict home prices
Creating a Machine Learning model to predict the home prices in Bangalore, India. We are going to use the dataset from Kaggle.com. We are also going to create a single page website which will provide the front end to access our model for predictions.

Below data science concepts are used in this project

Data loading and cleaning
Outlier detection and removal
Feature engineering
Dimensionality reduction
Gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning
K fold cross validation
Technology and tools used in this project

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Google Colaboratory Notebook
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
# Steps
We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests.
Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
Step#1: Import the required libraries

Step#2: Load the data

Step#3: Understand the data
        -drop unnecessary columns
        
Step#4: Data Cleaning
        - Check for na values
        - Verify unique values of each column
        - Make sure values are correct (eg. 23 BHK home with 2000 Sqrft size is worng)
        - Feature Engineering
        - Dimesionality Reduction
        - Outlier removal using domain knowledge (2bhk price < 3bhk price, size per bhk >= 300 sqft)
        - Outlier removal using standard eviation and mean
        - One Hot encoding
        
Step#5: Build Machine Learning Model

Step#6: Testing The model

Step#7: Export the model

Step#8: Export any other important info
